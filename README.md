# The Dog Wants In

We have a dog that's kind of "free range" and he used to scratch at the front
door to let us know he was back and wanted in.  Then we replaced the front door
and now he doesn't scratch which is actually kind of nice.  We didn't want him
to start scratching the new one anyway.

So, since I had an IP camera on the porch anyway I threw this together to make
an announcement when it detects a dog in the video feed.

The sound file is a record of me touched up in Audacity
a bit.
